## My Story
Short version:I started off in architecture with an interest in design and problem solving through the built environment. But after a few years of working in architecture, I felt I was not quite satisfied with what I was doing creatively.

 I decided to go into architecture since my dad was also a contractor, and I liked the idea of designing something that would be translated to a physical built environment that is functional for its users. So I had a lot of practice in starting with a problem and figuring how to resolve it with a building. Including doing site and community studies to understand a project. After finishing grad school and working for about 3 years, and I had started feeling somewhat unsatisfied with what I was doing in architecture. There was a lot less freedom of design that I had expected, and a lot of it was jumping through regulatory hoops and dealing with various steps of construction- itâ€™s a very old fashioned industry with excessive bureaucracy. All this was basically a lot of work and time for what felt like very little reward, compared to the education and effort I had put in to get there. There felt to be a lot less practical problem solving with architecture, and more just being the middleman solving problems in the process of getting a building built- correspondence with various city departments, researching different jurisditcional codes, contractor issues, scheduling, timing, pricing. I was in the process of studying for the architectural licensing exam around 2019, but then as we all know, covid hit and architecture ground to a near halt. I had started looked at different career changes, such as into engineering, and then into coding after a friend brought it up.

Though I initially had some regret leaving the architecture since I spent a long time working towards it, I later realized I wouldnâ€™t have learned a lot of important skills such as presentations, research, and making use of precedent design without having gone to architecture school. Also from working, how to talk with clients and users and understand their wants and needs, and knowing what is possible. So I found I did still have a love of problem solving through design, just not necessarily through buildings. I also saw in programming parallels to architecture, in how they both turn an abstract set of instructions into something functional and visually appealing to a user. I started with self learning through videos and tutorial sites such as FreeCodeCamp, before enrolling in LearningFuze's full stack web developer program. Now that I'm done with the program, I'm ready and eager to start my new career path as a developer!


*Fun fact*  Architects refer to programming as deciding project needs, where spaces go in a building and how they connect to meet those needs, and it's not uncommon to hear the phrase "programming a space". So I've seen a fair bit of confusion when an architect uses the word "programming" to someone in the tech world.
